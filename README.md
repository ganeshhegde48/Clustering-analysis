# Conclusion

To have a good understanding about the data, clustering is done and this helps us get to know about the type of customers who have been contributing to the sales.

Major customers : These customers have been transacting more frequently and are contributing to the major profits of the company

Average customers : This type of customers are less frequent contributors, but can be converted to major customers by providng discounts and best possible service.

Risky customers : There transactions are very rare and can be told that they are not customers anymore. But to regain these customers back some sales and discounts could help.
